# Dataset

This is the dataset we used on the paper "An Exploratory Study on Solidity Guards and Ether Exchange Constructs", presented at [WETSEB 2022](https://www.agile-group.org/wetseb2022/).

The file [dataset_wetseb2022_main.xlsx](dataset_wetseb2022_main.xlsx) contains the main main dataset on the first sheet, and each additional sheet focus on one of language contructs we analyzed (call, transfer, send, require, assert, revert).

In the file [dataset_wetseb_contracts_by_version.xlsx](dataset_wetseb_contracts_by_version.xlsx), we separated the sheets by the major Solidity version.

There is an online version (GoogleDoc) of the main dataset [on here](https://bit.ly/3fyOgBD).

Any questions please contact us, the authors (our email is on the paper).
