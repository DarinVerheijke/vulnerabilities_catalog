# Dataset Paper Wetseb 2022

This is the dataset we used on the paper "An Exploratory Study on Solidity Guards and Ether Exchange Constructs", presented at [WETSEB 2022](https://www.agile-group.org/wetseb2022/).

The file [dataset_wetseb2022_main.xlsx](dataset_wetseb2022_main.xlsx) contains the main main dataset on the first sheet, and each additional sheet focus on one of language contructs we analyzed (call, transfer, send, require, assert, revert). Every sheet has formulas calculating metrics (most of them appear on the paper).

In the file [dataset_wetseb_contracts_by_version.xlsx](dataset_wetseb_contracts_by_version.xlsx), we separated the sheets by the major Solidity version.

There is an online version (GoogleDoc) of the main dataset [on here](https://bit.ly/3fyOgBD). The online version has no formulas, and no additional sheets.

A dataset containing the contract addresses and the Etherscan pulled source codes can be found [on here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r4didSrIRc_0pJn629rmOgVXmrj6comp/view?usp=sharing).

Any questions please contact us, the authors (our email is on the paper).
